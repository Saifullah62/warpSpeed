# Advanced Reasoning Modules

## Overview

This package contains sophisticated reasoning engines designed to simulate advanced cognitive processes, integrating multiple reasoning strategies and cognitive mechanisms.

## Components

### 1. Causal Reasoning Engine
- Analyzes cause-and-effect relationships
- Performs causal interventions
- Generates causal path analysis

### 2. Abductive Reasoning Engine
- Generates and evaluates hypotheses
- Explores potential explanations
- Provides probabilistic hypothesis ranking

### 3. Meta-Cognitive Reasoning Engine
- Adaptive reasoning strategy selection
- Cross-strategy reasoning integration
- Reasoning trajectory analysis

## Key Features

- Dynamic strategy selection
- Uncertainty quantification
- Probabilistic reasoning framework
- Cognitive complexity modeling

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Example

```python
from reasoning.causal_reasoning_engine import CausalReasoningEngine
from reasoning.abductive_reasoning_engine import AbductiveReasoningEngine
from reasoning.meta_cognitive_reasoning_engine import MetaCognitiveReasoningEngine

# Initialize reasoning engines
causal_engine = CausalReasoningEngine()
abductive_engine = AbductiveReasoningEngine()
meta_reasoning_engine = MetaCognitiveReasoningEngine(
    causal_engine, 
    abductive_engine
)

# Perform reasoning
initial_context = {
    'domain': 'technology',
    'research_area': 'quantum computing'
}
reasoning_state = meta_reasoning_engine.initiate_reasoning_process(initial_context)
iteration_results = meta_reasoning_engine.reason_iteratively(reasoning_state.id)
```

## Performance Characteristics

- Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
