System Architecture
===================

This document provides an overview of the system architecture and design decisions.

High-Level Architecture
---------------------

Our system follows a modular, layered architecture:

Components
---------

UI Layer
~~~~~~~~
- Web interface built with React
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessibility compliance

API Layer
~~~~~~~~
- RESTful API endpoints
- GraphQL interface
- Authentication & authorization
- Rate limiting and caching
- API versioning

Business Logic Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Core processing algorithms
- Data validation
- Business rules enforcement
- Event processing
- Task scheduling

Data Layer
~~~~~~~~~
- Database interactions
- Data models
- Caching strategy
- Data validation
- Migration handling

Data Management
--------------

Dataset Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The project's dataset is hosted on Hugging Face and is not included in the GitHub repository. This separation helps:

* Reduce repository size
* Enable version control of data independently from code
* Provide easy access through the Hugging Face API
* Support large file storage and distribution

To work with the dataset:

1. Install the Hugging Face datasets library:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install datasets

2. Load the dataset in your code:

   .. code-block:: python

      from datasets import load_dataset
      dataset = load_dataset("Saifullah/StarTrekTechnology")

3. For local development, download the dataset files from Hugging Face and place them in the ``data/`` directory.

Data Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The data processing pipeline is designed to:

* Load data from local files or Hugging Face
* Process and clean the data
* Generate knowledge graphs
* Export processed data for visualization

Design Principles
---------------

1. Separation of Concerns
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Clear boundaries between layers
   - Modular design for easy testing

2. SOLID Principles
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle

   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle

3. Security by Design
   - Authentication & authorization
   - Input validation
   - Data encryption
   - Audit logging
   - Regular security testing

4. Performance Optimization
   - Caching strategy
   - Database optimization
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Resource pooling
   - Load balancing

Technology Stack
--------------

Frontend
~~~~~~~~
- React.js for UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI for components
- Jest for testing

Backend
~~~~~~~

- FastAPI for REST API
- GraphQL with Strawberry
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Pytest for testing

Database
~~~~~~~~
